# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Source: `app/` (routes in `app/routes/*`, root layout in `app/root.tsx`, components in `app/welcome/*`).
- Routing: `app/routes.ts` defines the route table; files in `app/routes/` are route modules.
- Public assets: `public/` (e.g., `public/favicon.ico`).
- Config: `vite.config.ts`, `react-router.config.ts` (SSR is enabled), `tsconfig.json` (strict TS, path alias `~/* -> app/*`).
- Build output: `build/` generated by `pnpm build` (`build/client`, `build/server`).
- Docker: `Dockerfile` builds and serves the production app.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `pnpm dev`: Start local dev server with HMR via React Router.
- `pnpm build`: Create production build (client and server bundles).
- `pnpm start`: Serve the built app (`build/server/index.js`).
- `pnpm typecheck`: Generate route types then run `tsc`.
- Docker: `docker build -t morning-glory . && docker run -p 3000:3000 morning-glory`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript, ES2022 modules, JSX (`react-jsx`). Use 2-space indentation.
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `Welcome`); variables/functions: camelCase.
- Routes: lowercase filenames under `app/routes/` (e.g., `home.tsx`).
- Imports: prefer alias `~/*` for paths within `app/`.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS is configured via Vite plugin.

## Testing Guidelines
- No test runner is configured yet. Recommended stack: Vitest + React Testing Library.
- Place tests next to sources: `app/**/__tests__/*.{test,spec}.tsx` or `*.test.tsx`.
- Target key behaviors (route loaders/actions, components, error boundaries). Aim for meaningful coverage over a fixed threshold.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: Prefer Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`). Keep changes focused.
- PRs: Include a clear summary, linked issues (e.g., `Closes #123`), and screenshots/GIFs for UI changes.
- CI/Build: Ensure `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm build` pass before requesting review.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- SSR is enabled in `react-router.config.ts` (`ssr: true`). Toggle to `false` for SPA-only builds if required.
- Never commit secrets. Use environment variables and your platformâ€™s secret store.
- Validate external inputs in loaders/actions and handle errors via `ErrorBoundary`.
